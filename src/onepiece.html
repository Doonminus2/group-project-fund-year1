            Barely surviving in a barrel after passing through a terrible
            whirlpool at sea, carefree Monkey D. Luffy ends up aboard a ship
            under attack by fearsome pirates. Despite being a naive-looking
            teenager, he is not to be underestimated. Unmatched in battle, Luffy
            is a pirate himself who resolutely pursues the coveted One Piece
            treasure and the King of the Pirates title that comes with it. The
            late King of the Pirates, Gol D. Roger, stirred up the world before
            his death by disclosing the whereabouts of his hoard of riches and
            daring everyone to obtain it. Ever since then, countless powerful
            pirates have sailed dangerous seas for the prized One Piece only to
            never return. Although Luffy lacks a crew and a proper ship, he is
            endowed with a superhuman ability and an unbreakable spirit that
            make him not only a formidable adversary but also an inspiration to
            many. As he faces numerous challenges with a big smile on his face,
            Luffy gathers one-of-a-kind companions to join him in his ambitious
            endeavor, together embracing perils and wonders on their
            once-in-a-lifetime adventure.

                Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates and is best
                friends with all of them and values them over all else. At first
                glance, Luffy does not appear to be very intelligent, often
                seeing things in a childish manner and can easily be amazed by
                the simplest things. However, because he views the world in a
                straightforward and simple manner, he is occasionally the only
                person who can see past the events and see what should be done.

                Zoro was the first crew member to be recruited by Luffy. Zoro is
                a skilled swordsman who fights with his own unique sword style
                known as santoryu (three katana fighting style). This is
                achieved by using one katana in each hand and another in his
                mouth. He is also seen fighting with only one or two swords.
                When in a serious fight he ties his bandana, normally tied on
                the arm, on his head.
