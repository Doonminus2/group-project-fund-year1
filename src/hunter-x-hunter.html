            Hunters are specialized in a wide variety of fields, ranging from
            treasure hunting to cooking. They have access to otherwise
            unavailable funds and information that allow them to pursue their
            dreams and interests. However, being a hunter is a special
            privilege, only attained by taking a deadly exam with an extremely
            low success rate. Gon Freecss, a 12-year-old boy with the hope of
            finding his missing father, sets out on a quest to take the Hunter
            Exam. Along the way, he picks up three companions who also aim to
            take the dangerous test: the revenge-seeking Kurapika, aspiring
            doctor Leorio Paladiknight, and a mischievous child the same age as
            Gon, Killua Zoldyck. As the four aspiring hunters embark on a
            perilous adventure, they fight for their dreams while defying the
            odds.

                Gon wants to become a Hunter because he wishes to find out the
                depths of an occupation that would cause a father to choose the
                profession over being with his own son. Gon is an athletic,
                rustic, and friendly boy who is searching for adventure. Also,
                he is not very good at math. However, having spent a lot of time
                in the woods as a child, he is very good with animals.
                Simultaneously, his flaws lie in his temper and impulsive
                nature. Gon sometimes fails to think things through and such
                actions lead to him suffering. Though possessing talent far
                beyond the norm for his age, anytime his abilities are
                challenged, he feels as if he has to prove his antagonist wrong.

                Killua Zoldyck is the third child of Silva and Kikyo Zoldyck and
                the heir (former) of the Zoldyck Family. He is the deuteragonist
                of the series Hunter x Hunter. Killua is introduced as a
                character similar to Gon: cheeky, cheerful, and full of bad
                ideas. However, contrasting Gon's politeness, Killua can be
                pretty rude to others, mostly strangers and older people.
