            Ever since the death of his father, the burden of supporting the
            family has fallen upon Tanjirou Kamado's shoulders. Though living
            impoverished on a remote mountain, the Kamado family are able to
            enjoy a relatively peaceful and happy life. One day, Tanjirou
            decides to go down to the local village to make a little money
            selling charcoal. On his way back, night falls, forcing Tanjirou to
            take shelter in the house of a strange man, who warns him of the
            existence of flesh-eating demons that lurk in the woods at night.
            When he finally arrives back home the next day, he is met with a
            horrifying sightâ€”his whole family has been slaughtered. Worse still,
            the sole survivor is his sister Nezuko, who has been turned into a
            bloodthirsty demon. Consumed by rage and hatred, Tanjirou swears to
            avenge his family and stay by his only remaining sibling. Alongside
            the mysterious group calling themselves the Demon Slayer Corps,
            Tanjirou will do whatever it takes to slay the demons and protect
            the remnants of his beloved sister's humanity.

                Tanjirou Kamado is the main protagonist of Kimetsu no Yaiba, who
                becomes a Demon Hunter and joins the Demon Killing Corps to hunt
                down the demon who murdered his family and turned his sister
                Nezuko into a demon. Tanjirou is kind by nature and has been
                described by others as having very gentle eyes. He has a great
                deal of determination and will not give up once he has a goal to
                achieve, an example being finding a cure for Nezuko. Even though
                he is relatively strong on his own, he isn't opposed to asking
                others for help when he needs it. He is very protective of his
                friends and even more so of his younger sister. His biggest
                attribute is his ability to empathize with anyone, even demons.
