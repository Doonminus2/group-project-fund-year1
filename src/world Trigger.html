          <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">
            When a gate to another world suddenly opens on Earth, Mikado City is
            invaded by strange creatures known as "Neighbors," malicious beings
            impervious to traditional weaponry. In response to their arrival, an
            organization called the Border Defense Agency has been established
            to combat the Neighbor menace through special weapons called
            "Triggers." Even though several years have passed after the gate
            first opened, Neighbors are still a threat and members of Border
            remain on guard to ensure the safety of the planet. Despite this
            delicate situation, members-in-training, such as Osamu Mikumo, are
            not permitted to use their Triggers outside of headquarters. But
            when the mysterious new student in his class is dragged into a
            forbidden area by bullies, they are attacked by Neighbors, and Osamu
            has no choice but to do what he believes is right. Much to his
            surprise, however, the transfer student Yuuma Kuga makes short work
            of the aliens, revealing that he is a humanoid Neighbor in disguise.

                Chika Amatori is one of the main protagonists of World Trigger.
                Chika is very shy, and rarely says much. She has very few
                friends, because she voluntarily distances herself from others.
                She believes that she'll just get hurt when those she gets close
                to get kidnapped by the Neighbors. She is really patient and
                serious and can concentrate very well, but she has low
                confidence and can't see her own potential. After meeting Yuuma
                and joining Tamakoma Branch, however, she starts warming up to
                others and becoming more sociable and confident on herself. She
                is a kind-hearted person and admits that she is terrified of
                hurting others.
