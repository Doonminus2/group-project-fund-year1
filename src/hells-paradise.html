            Sentenced to death, ninja Gabimaru the Hollow finds himself
            apathetic. After leading a blood-soaked life, Gabimaru believes he
            deserves to die. However, every attempt to execute him inexplicably
            fails. Finally, Sagiri Yamada Asaemon, a fledgling member of a famed
            executioner clan, is asked to take Gabimaru's life; yet Sagiri makes
            no move to kill him as requested. Insisting that Gabimaru will not
            die because of his love for his wife, Sagiri instead offers him the
            chance to obtain a full pardon for his crimes. If he can travel to
            the island of Shinsekyo and obtain the Elixir of Life—which
            supposedly grants immortality—and bring it back for the shogun, then
            his freedom will be assured. But of the many who have traveled to
            Shinsekyo in search of the mythical Elixir, not a single person has
            returned sound of mind, if at all. Though unaware of the numerous
            dangers ahead, Gabimaru decides to accept the offer—alongside ten
            other death row convicts—in hope that he and his wife may finally
            live in peace.

                He is a very calm and serious person who is convinced that he
                has no feelings. Therefore, he behaves monotonously and only

                about because he is madly in love with her.
