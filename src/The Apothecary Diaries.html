          <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">
            Maomao, an apothecary's daughter, has been plucked from her peaceful
            life and sold to the lowest echelons of the imperial court. Now
            merely a maid, Maomao settles into her new mundane life and hides
            her extensive knowledge of medicine in order to avoid any unwanted
            attention. Not long after Maomao's arrival, the emperor's infant
            children inexplicably begin to experience grave symptomsâ€”almost as
            if a curse has been cast. The curious Maomao easily solves the
            mystery and, to remain out of the limelight, attempts to leave an
            anonymous tip. Unfortunately, the dashing and perceptive eunuch
            Jinshi sees through it and manages to single her out. In recognition
            of her talent, Maomao is promoted to lady-in-waiting for the
            emperor's favorite concubine, Gyokuyou. As Maomao continues to
            remedy the numerous ailments afflicting the imperial court, her
            pharmaceutical expertise quickly proves indispensable.

                Maomao became a maidservant to the Emperor's harem after being
                kidnapped and sold. She used to live with her father as a
                pharmacist in the red light district and is very knowledgeable
                about medicine and poisons but isn't very interested in other

                Jinshi is the deuteragonist of Kusuriya no Hitorigoto. He
                appears to be beautiful eunuch who was placed in charge of the
                inner palace and often requests for Maomao to solve mysteries in
                the palace in exchange for rare medicines. He finds Maomao's
                apathy toward him refreshing and amusing. Later, his childish
                curiosity evolves into a one-sided romantic affection.
