          <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">
            Ever since having witnessed the "Little Giant" and his astonishing
            skills on the volleyball court, Shouyou Hinata has been bewitched by
            the dynamic nature of the sport. Even though his attempt to make his
            debut as a volleyball regular during a middle school tournament went
            up in flames, he longs to prove that his less-than-impressive height
            ceases to be a hindrance in the face of his sheer will and
            perseverance. When Hinata enrolls in Karasuno High School, the
            Little Giant's alma mater, he believes that he is one step closer to
            his goal of becoming a professional volleyball player. Although the
            school only retains a shadow of its former glory, Hinata's
            conviction isn't shaken until he learns that Tobio Kageyama—the
            prodigy who humiliated Hinata's middle school volleyball team in a
            crushing defeat—is now his teammate. To fulfill his desire of
            leaving a mark on the realm of volleyball—so often regarded as the
            domain of the tall and the strong—Hinata must smooth out his
            differences with Kageyama. Only when Hinata learns what it takes to
            be a part of a team will he be able to join the race to the top in
            earnest.

                Hinata has an unusually high ability to jump. Since he was
                young, Hinata trained his legs to compensate for his lack of
                height. He joins Karusuno High School Volleyball team and amazes
                the team with his natural affinity as a spiker. Although he is a
                complete beginner and never had any experience playing in a
                volleyball team, he grows rapidly through each match.

               Kageyama was initially referred to as "King of the Court," a derogatory nickname that insinuates his autocratic nature, given to him by his former teammates at Kitagawa Daiichi during his late middle school days. Kageyama is widely regarded as a stunning prodigy and an absolute genius by many of the prefecture's players and coaches. After joining Karasuno, he manages to change his attitude for the better with the help of his new teammates and rediscover what it means to be part of a team.
