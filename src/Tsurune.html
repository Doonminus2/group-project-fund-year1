          <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">
            "Tsurune"â€”It's the sound made by the bowstring when an arrow is
            released, and the sound that inspired Minato Narumiya to learn
            kyudo, a modern Japanese martial art focusing on archery. However,
            an incident during his last middle school tournament caused him to
            quit the sport. But soon, many factors conspire to make Minato take
            up the bow once again: the start of a new kyudo club in his high
            school, a chance encounter with a mysterious archer, and the support
            of his childhood friends, Seiya Takehaya and Ryouhei Yamanouchi.
            Together with his childhood friends and his new teammates, Kaito
            Onogi and Nanao Kisaragi, Minato rekindles his love for kyudo and
            works with his team toward their aim of winning the prefectural
            tournament.

               Masaki Takigawa is a mysterious man that Minato meets at the "Evening Forest Archery Dojo." He has a fluttering personality but top-tier and beautiful archery skills.
