          <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">
            Gokuu Son is a young boy who lives in the woods all aloneâ€”that is,
            until a girl named Bulma runs into him in her search for a set of
            magical objects called the "Dragon Balls." Since the artifacts are
            said to grant one wish to whoever collects all seven, Bulma hopes to
            gather them and wish for a perfect boyfriend. Gokuu happens to be in
            possession of a dragon ball, but unfortunately for Bulma, he refuses
            to part ways with it, so she makes him a deal: he can tag along on
            her journey if he lets her borrow the dragon ball's power. With
            that, the two set off on the journey of a lifetime. They don't go on
            the journey alone. On the way, they meet the old Muten-Roshi and
            wannabe disciple Kuririn, with whom Gokuu trains to become a
            stronger martial artist for the upcoming World Martial Arts
            Tournament. However, it's not all fun and games; the ability to make
            any wish come true is a powerful one, and there are others who would
            do much worse than just wishing for a boyfriend. To stop those who
            would try to abuse the legendary power, they train to become
            stronger fighters, using their newfound strength to help the people
            around them along the way.

                Originally named Kakarot, Gokuu is born a member of a race of
                extraterrestrials called the Saiyans. Shortly following his
                birth, Gokuu is sent from his native planet Vegeta to Earth, for
                potential selling on the intergalactic market by destroying all
                its life; Goku was also sent away to escape Freeza's genocide of
                the Saiyans. Once he lands on Earth, he is adopted by an old man
                named Gohan (who is later just called Grandpa Gohan).

                Bulma is originally a secondary main character, but her role is
                quickly downplayed as the series continues, even though she does
                remain an important support character for most of the series.
                Bulma is a direct parody of the character Xuanzang from the
                Chinese novel Journey to the West. Even though Bulma's character
                parodies a monk, her Japanese name "Buruma" is the brand of a
                popular gym short worn by girls in Japan. Her re-adapted name
                Bulma is a direct take on the word "bloomers," which was a
                popular brand of women's underwear in the early 20th century.
